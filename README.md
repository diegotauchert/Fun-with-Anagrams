# Fun with Anagrams
Hackerrank Challenger in PHP

Two strings are anagrams, if they are permutations of each other. In other words, both strings have the same size and the same characters. For example, “aaagmnrs” is an anagram of “anagrams”. Give an array of strings, remove each string that is an anagram of an earlier string, then return the remaining array in sorted order.
